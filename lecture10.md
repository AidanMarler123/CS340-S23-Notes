Remember: 
- __internal quality__: developer-facing quality 
- __external quality__: customer-facing quality

## Testing a Python list
If we were to try and create tests for a list in python, what might we test?
- Does it append correctly?
    - after appending, does the rest of the list stay the same?
- Does it "pop" correctly?
    - after popping, does the length of the list change?
    - after popping, what happens when we try to access the most recently removed iten?
- This can get complicated really quick

# Software Testing
__Def__: an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the software produt or service under review.
