## Notes

Software vs. Programs

- program: collect of instructions or ordered operations for a computer to preform a function or task
- software: collection of programs procedures, data, or instructions that work together to provide a specified functionality
- Similarities and differences:
    - similarities: programming languages, coding
    - differences: public, size, security, usability, quality control

Time allocation to various SE tasks

- 70 - 90% of the budget / time is spent on maintenance
